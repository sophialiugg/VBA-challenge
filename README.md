# VBA-challenge

## Background
You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel expert! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

## Files
Download the following files to help you get started:

## Instructions
* Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

 * The ticker symbol.

 * Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

 * The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

 * The total stock volume of the stock. 

 * Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

 * Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

The result should match the following image:

## Note
* Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red. (Requirements asked for conditional formatting to be applied to both yearly change column and the percent change column)

## Other Considerations
* Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in under 3 to 5 minutes.

* Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.
